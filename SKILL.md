# Geometric Analysis

Analyze any claim, concept, or situation using Spinoza's geometric method: proceeding from definitions through axioms to demonstrated propositions.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "Demonstrate this" or "Prove this to me"
- User asks "What follows necessarily from this?"
- Complex concepts that need rigorous clarification
- Disputes that can be resolved through definitional precision
- Foundational questions about what something really is
- User presents confused or circular reasoning

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| claim_or_concept | Yes | The claim to analyze or concept to clarify |
| context | No | Relevant background information |
| objections | No | Counter-arguments or difficulties to address |

## The Spinozist Framework

Spinoza modeled his *Ethics* on Euclid's *Elements*, believing that philosophical truths could be demonstrated with mathematical certainty. The geometric method proceeds:

1. **Definitions** establish the meaning of terms
2. **Axioms** state self-evident truths
3. **Propositions** follow necessarily from definitions and axioms
4. **Demonstrations** prove propositions
5. **Corollaries** draw additional implications
6. **Scholia** offer informal explanation

### Why This Method Works

- Forces precise definition of terms (most disputes arise from ambiguity)
- Distinguishes assumptions from conclusions
- Makes logical connections explicit
- Reveals hidden premises
- Produces conclusions that *follow necessarily* rather than merely seem plausible

---

## Analysis Steps

### Step 1: Identify the Core Question

What is actually being asked or claimed? Strip away rhetorical flourishes to find the essential content.

### Step 2: Define Key Terms

For each important term:
- State what you understand by it
- Ensure the definition doesn't presuppose what you're trying to prove
- Make definitions clear enough that others can work with them

**Example:**
> "By substance I understand what is in itself and is conceived through itself; that is, that whose concept does not require the concept of another thing from which it must be formed."

### Step 3: State Your Axioms

What truths do you take as self-evident? These are your starting points—they must be:
- Genuinely evident (not contentious)
- Sufficient (enough to derive your conclusions)
- Independent (not secretly containing your conclusion)

**Example:**
> "Whatever is, is either in itself or in another."

### Step 4: Derive Propositions

State what follows from your definitions and axioms. For each proposition:
- State it clearly
- Provide the demonstration (proof)
- Use only previously established material

**Example:**
> **Proposition:** Except God, no substance can be or be conceived.
> **Demonstration:** By Definition 3, substance is what is conceived through itself. By Axiom 1, whatever is, is either in itself or in another. If another substance existed, it would need to be conceived through itself—but then it would share attributes with God, which by Proposition 5 is impossible. Therefore, only one substance can exist.

### Step 5: Draw Corollaries

What additional conclusions follow from your propositions?

### Step 6: Provide Scholium (Optional)

Offer informal clarification, address likely objections, or explain the significance of what you've demonstrated.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown

### Definitions

**Definition 1:** By [term] I understand [precise meaning].

**Definition 2:** By [term] I understand [precise meaning].

[Continue as needed]

### Axioms

**Axiom 2:** [Self-evident truth]

[Continue as needed]

### Propositions

**Proposition 1:** [Statement]

**Demonstration:** [Proof using only definitions, axioms, and prior propositions]

**Proposition 2:** [Statement]

**Demonstration:** [Proof]

[Continue as needed]

### Corollaries

**Corollary 1:** [Additional implication]

**Corollary 2:** [Additional implication]

### Scholium

[Informal discussion of significance, objections, or applications]

### Conclusion

## Constraints

- Every term in your propositions must be defined or commonly understood
- Every proposition must be demonstrable from prior material—no leaps
- Distinguish clearly between what is assumed (axioms) and what is proved (propositions)
- If you cannot demonstrate something, acknowledge it honestly
- The method reveals when claims *cannot* be proven—this is valuable information

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]

```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Analyze whether free will exists"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Geometric Analysis: The Question of Free Will

### Definitions

**Definition 1:** By *free will* I understand a power to act or refrain from acting that is not determined by prior causes—the ability to have done otherwise in exactly the same circumstances.

**Definition 2:** By *cause* I understand that from which something necessarily follows.

**Definition 3:** By *determination* I understand the relation whereby, given a cause, an effect necessarily follows.

**Definition 4:** By *human action* I understand any behavior proceeding from human will or desire.

### Axioms

**Axiom 1:** Nothing comes from nothing; every event has a cause.

**Axiom 2:** The same cause, under the same conditions, produces the same effect.

**Axiom 3:** Human beings are part of nature, not exempt from natural laws.

### Propositions

**Proposition 1:** Every human action has a cause.

**Demonstration:** By Axiom 3, human beings are part of nature. By Axiom 1, everything in nature has a cause. Human actions are events in nature. Therefore, every human action has a cause. Q.E.D.

**Proposition 2:** Given the cause of a human action, that action necessarily follows.

**Demonstration:** By Definition 3, determination is the relation whereby, given a cause, an effect necessarily follows. By Axiom 2, the same cause produces the same effect. Human actions have causes (Proposition 1). Therefore, given those causes, human actions necessarily follow. Q.E.D.

**Proposition 3:** Free will (as defined) does not exist.

**Demonstration:** By Definition 1, free will is a power to act that is not determined by prior causes. By Proposition 2, given the causes of human action, those actions necessarily follow. What necessarily follows from prior causes is determined. Therefore, human actions are determined. What is determined cannot be undetermined. Therefore, free will (as defined) does not exist. Q.E.D.

### Corollaries

**Corollary 1:** The feeling of having free will arises from ignorance of causes. We are conscious of our desires but not of the causes that determine those desires.

**Corollary 2:** Moral responsibility must be reconceived. If free will does not exist, blame and praise based on "could have done otherwise" are confused.

**Corollary 3:** A different kind of freedom remains possible: freedom as acting from one's own nature rather than external compulsion—not the absence of determination, but self-determination.

### Scholium

This demonstration does not diminish human dignity but clarifies it. The common notion of free will—that we could have acted otherwise in identical circumstances—is incoherent when examined precisely. Yet this does not reduce us to mere automatons.

Consider: when we understand why we act as we do, when our actions flow from adequate ideas rather than confused passions, we act *more* freely in the sense that matters. The sage who understands necessity is not a puppet but someone whose actions express their true nature. Bondage is not determination but determination by external causes and inadequate ideas. Freedom is not the absence of determination but determination by our own adequate understanding.

The illusion of libertarian free will arises because we are conscious of our desires while ignorant of their causes—like a stone that, if conscious, would believe it freely chose to fall.

### Conclusion

Free will, defined as undetermined choice, cannot exist consistently with the causal order of nature. However, a meaningful freedom remains: self-determination through understanding. The path to this freedom lies not in escaping causation but in becoming the adequate cause of one's own actions through knowledge.
